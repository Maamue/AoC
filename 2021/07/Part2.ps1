    Every crab movement needs to be calcualted for each position
    So for each position we move every crab around and see how expensive it is
    [Math]::Abs() gives us the absolute value so we don't need wo work with even/odd averages

    https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gau%C3%9Fsche_Summenformel
    This time it is a classic GauÃŸ sum formula:
    The sum of n to y consecutive natural numbers can be expressed as
    k(0) to n = (n(n+1))/2 or (n^2 +n) / 2
